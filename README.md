Arduino ESP8266
==

After going through many tutorials about the ESP8266 and Arduino ( nano in my case ), I quickly realized there was not a good example of it in use.

Todo
--
* [ ] Async http calls
* [ ] ESP8266 specific code broken out in HTTP library
* [ ] Remove hardcoded variables
* [ ] Implement header bases authentication
