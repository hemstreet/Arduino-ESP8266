**work in progress**

Arduino ESP8266
==

After going through many tutorials about the ESP8266 and Arduino ( nano in my case ), I quickly realized there was not a good example of it in use.

Setup
---
Rename `_config.h` to `config.h` and update the values

Todo
--
* [ ] Async http calls
* [ ] ESP8266 specific code broken out in HTTP library
* [x] Remove hardcoded variables ( need to extend out config )
* [ ] Implement header bases authentication
* [ ] Organize config / libraries in subfolders because we aren't children
